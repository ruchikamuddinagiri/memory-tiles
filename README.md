## Thoughts  
To make the game more exciting, we added a timer to create a sense of urgency. After completing each level, players can see the Pokémon they've caught, which adds to the fun. We also introduced bonus rounds where players can catch rare Pokémon, making the game feel more like a real Pokémon hunting adventure.

Our journey was made even better by the amazing team we worked with. They were creative and full of great ideas, which helped us improve the project. We communicated well, discussed things quickly, and divided tasks efficiently, which made our teamwork effective and well-coordinated.
