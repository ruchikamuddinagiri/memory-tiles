## Reflection  
Working with a remarkable team of highly skilled and motivated individuals was a significant asset to our project. The team consistently demonstrated exceptional creativity, consistently generating innovative ideas to enhance our project's quality. Effective communication was a cornerstone of our collaboration, enabling us to discuss ideas and tasks with remarkable efficiency, thus ensuring our teamwork was both seamless and productive.

One of the key tools that greatly facilitated our project management was the GitHub Project board. This platform proved instrumental in keeping track of tasks assigned to each team member, maintaining a high level of consistency throughout the development process, and fostering transparency in our project's evolution.

Our journey through this project broadened our comprehension of web technologies, real-time communication protocols, and the intricacies of game development. Debugging errors became an enjoyable and collaborative endeavor, contributing to our development of efficient troubleshooting and problem-solving skills.

Developing a game tailored for video call interactions brought forth a unique array of challenges. Central to our efforts was ensuring the game's real-time synchronization, mitigating latency issues, and crafting a user-friendly interface. The nuances of network problems, including lag and dropped connections, posed significant obstacles that demanded creative solutions. Additionally, the task of designing the game to be engaging and entertaining in the context of video calls necessitated meticulous attention to user experience, further challenging our problem-solving abilities.

Regarding the game we were in the process of creating, we harbored ambitious plans to enhance its appeal. Our vision encompassed the incorporation of a timer to heighten the challenge, granting players the opportunity to view the Pokémon they had captured after completing each level, and even introducing special bonus rounds where rare Pokémon could be captured. These features aimed to deliver a more immersive and realistic Pokémon hunting experience. Unfortunately, due to time constraints, we were unable to implement these elements as part of the project's scope. Nevertheless, we regard them as intriguing possibilities to explore in the future, potentially elevating the game to new heights.

In conclusion, the development of a web-based game intended for video call interactions represents a valuable educational experience. It seamlessly intertwined technical, collaborative, and user-centric dimensions, allowing us to apply the knowledge acquired in the classroom to a tangible project. Above all, it reinforced the significance of adaptability and creativity when confronting challenges, serving as a testament to our capacity for growth. This project not only enriched our technical skills but also honed our capacity to function effectively within a team and highlighted the paramount importance of prioritizing the user experience, paving the way for a future marked by more sophisticated and user-centric creations.
